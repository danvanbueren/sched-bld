build objects from classes to represent individual sorties and persons

Each person object will have the following variables
- first name
- last name
- crew position
- rank

- FILTER
	- array of appointments… each appointment will contain
		- start date
		- end date
		- description
		- boolean to represent fly/no fly
	- DNIF/no fly status
		- optional auto enable fly status by date
- SORT
	- total look-back (past month & past 3 months) [probably best to track all sorties a person has completed]
	- rap (ignoring for now cause its an animal I don’t understand yet)

Each sortie object will have the following variables
- sortie number (string)
- t/o & t/d dates (add option to specify explicit t/o & t/d dates/times, otherwise assume same day/all day)
- array of persons currently loaded on that sortie
- array of persons still required to afford sortie requirements
